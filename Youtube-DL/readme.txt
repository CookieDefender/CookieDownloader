I did not make the youtube-dl.exe or the other two exe's in this directory. They are tools I came across when using a music bot for a teamspeak 3 server. If you are uncomfortable using the .exe inside the folder then get them from the following
Youtube-DL - https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html
FFmpeg and FFprobe - https://ffmpeg.org/

//

1) Run the "RUN THIS.bat" or the "URL to OGG.bat"
2) Follow the prompts!
3) If something breaks, contact CookieDefender and let him know!
